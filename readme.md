# Fluke – A Minimal Text Editor

Fluke is a small, lightweight text editor written in C, inspired by [kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/).
It’s designed to be **simple, fast, and easy to understand**, both for users who want a clean editing experience and for developers who want to dive into the codebase.

## ✨ Features

* Line numbering
* Lightweight — no external dependencies
